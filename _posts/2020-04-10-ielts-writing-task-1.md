# 1. THE RATIO OF BIRTH AND DEATH IN NEW ZEALAND![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4mHVTiQsxQBMWVGaPC0NXu9npvrtKuhamhnwVJYvNPDz9__47MM4fweXLeUa7UJTIIr6MycvJa-Cy804w36nml_FUjn2g4CJWhnUJD7uD9c2UgX9WTPLFr3Fm6Rqzofr28_dVcoB)

## TRAIN

The line graph illustrates the information about the changes in the fertility and death rates in New Zealand in a course of 200 years from 1901 to 2101.

Overall, it's easy to see that have a reserved between death and birth rates in the year 2041, while in the first period from 1901 to 2041 was dominated by birth rates, the figure for the second period from 2041 to 2101 was death rates.

On the one hand, there was a fluatuate in





## SAMPLE

The line graph gives information **concerning (= about)** the changes in New Zealand's **fertility** and **death** rate over the period from 1901 to 2101. Over the 60-year period, from 1901 to 1961, there was **a considerable change** in the birth rates of New Zealand. **In more details**, the birth rates fluctuated slightly between 20000 and 30000 during the first 40 years from 1901 to 1941, then growing **exponentially** to 65000 in 1961. Afterwards, **the rate varied** considerably from 50000 to 65000 until the present day and it is **anticipated (= expect, to imagine or expect that something will happen)** to fall slowly to 40000 in the end of the century. (â†’ at the end of something). The death rates, meanwhile, rose gradually from 9000 to nearly 30000 in the twentieth century and maintained at over a half of the birth rates. This was followed by a period of rapid acceleration, with death in the country reaching the peak of 60000 in 2061. However, the following 4 decades is expected to have no more significant changes.
Overall, the huge gap between New Zealand's birth and death rates is probably being reversed at around 2041 ever since.

**"then growing exponentially". You need a comma at this point to break the sentence. It should have been "from 1901 to 1941, and then it grew..."****Or you can use "before" instead.**"in the end of". There is only "at the end of sth"" ever since". I think it is a little bit risky because you are only discussing about the given period from 1901 to 2101.

## FEEDBACK

Clarify your format. The first paragraph should have only the following summary:- Type of graph- Measurement indicator- Years covered- Sources of measurement- Trending statement
You must start a new paragraph for every data comparison that you provide. It should not be made as a part of the trending statement as the aforementioned statement is one that creates the direction for the information reporting in the essay. The information presentation should have had its own paragraph starting with; "In more details..."You covered everything in the essay except the **comparison where relevant**. Which means, you did not notice the overlapping information that would have responded to that task requirement. You missed indicating that:
The data for birth and death has been projected to overlap at about 45 % between the years 2021 and 2041.
Such a comparison point is important in the analysis of the line graph because it shows the assumed / expected population of the people from New Zealand during that projected time period.

# 2. FORESTED LAND

The table shows forested land in millions of hectares in different parts of the world. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant. You should spend about 20 minutes on this task.![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LtUi5JfwokVhxDd2x9303YrVQVnMSEUDkmsBL-Cn2U_5CMjozqp5h8BHwgxckE5csKWPRvjybz5jmjj2xox_0QqpPPeexqARDfUAVMIPDZFc_MfLTv7k1zoY_fhUn0cU3GckwSqw)

## SAMPLE 1

The chart illustrates data **regarding** forested land **measured by** millions of hectares in multiple regions of the globe. Overall, after the course of 15 years, there was a slight expansion in the forest area in Asia and Europe, **whilst (= while, UK)** the opposite trend was observed in the remained regions. Moreover, European countries always had the largest forest area when compared to the rest.
In 1990, Asian countries had 576 millions of hectares of forest area. This figure slightly dropped to 570 million in 2000 and significantly rose to 584 million after 5 years. Meanwhile, **there was an observable surge** over the period of 15 years in Europe, starting at 989 millions of hectares in 1990 and reaching 1001 million in 2005.
On the other hand, African region lost their forest area dramatically. They used to have 749 millions of hectares in 1990 but this number declined steeply to 691 million in 2005. There was a slight decrease in forested land in North America from 708 millions of hectares to 705 million and this statistic remained unchanged for the next 5 years. **The same trend applied to** Oceania. South America suffered the greatest loss of forest area. After 15 years from 1990, the forest area in this region was measured at 882 millions of hectares, significantly smaller than its figure in 1990 (946 millions of hectares).

## FEEDBACK 1

The task 1 essay should not exceed 190 words because you only have 20 minutes to complete this task. You should not be focused on the number of words as that will never ensure a high score. Your ability to properly explain the image, note important data in your report, along with how you present the information in a grammatically correct manner are what will dictate your passing or failing score. Focus on the content, not the word count. The word count won't get you anywhere if your content is faulty.
Overview information should include a listing of the included global regions in the chart. You can either outline that information or, use the countries as indicative of your trending sentence. Whatever the method you choose, just make sure that all the countries are represented / outlined / listed in the summary overview. That is part of the data presentation outline and adds to the accuracy of your task.
Be consistent in your paragraph starter phrases. **If you use "on the other hand" in the second paragraph, make sure that you used "On the one hand" in the previous paragraph.** The uniformity of presentation is important in each paragraph that you discuss. Be careful with your spelling. Watch out for the red lines that appear under words as you type your text. That represents a misspelled word. You must correct it. Note that the red lines will not appear on the testing center computer, so you have to make sure that you avoid the forced spelling errors by looking for it as you do the practice test. Remember, the LR score will also look at your spelling accuracy and deduct for misspelled and misused words / vocabulary.
Grammar errors:Noun phrase disagreement - 749 millions = million*709 millions of hectares = million*(You consistently make this error in the essay. It could have been corrected if you did some editing work in the paper before you close the essay)
Do not fall prey to forced errors in the essay that could cause you to fail the test. If you apply your editing skills to the copy before you submit the essay, if you focus on content instead of word count, you can avoid those forced errors and perhaps, pass the test.

## SAMPLE 2

The diagram indicates forest area of different districts around the world in 1990, 2000 and 2005.Apparently, forest area of Oceania is the least and Europe has the largest forest land. We can also find that the area of forest land in South America and Africa decreased a lot from 1990 to 2005.
It is clear that the total area of woods in Oceania in 1990, 2000 and 2005 has never been over 200 millions of hectares which is far less than woods areas of other districts. The area of European forest in 1990, 2000 and 2005 is around 1000 millions of hectares which is the most among all districts.
We can see that in 1990 the forest land area of South America is 946 millions of hectares. However, in 2005 it drops to 882 millions of hectares. African forests were faced with the same issue: from 1990 to 2005, its area went down from 749 to 691 millions of hectares.

## FEEDBACK 2

You can use some words that are more formal. For example, significantly instead of a lot.For your last paragragh, I think you can add some more adjectives to enforce that it is dropping immensely.
You need to be precise when it comes to describing the image that is presented to you for analysis. That means, you need to know the difference between a diagram, a chart, a table, and a graph. The graphs come in various forms as well. You need to make sure to use the right descriptive term for the image otherwise you relay wrong information to the reader. What you have here is a table, not a diagram. A diagram is a drawing of a series of instructions for the development of a product or place. You must familiarize yourself with these terms otherwise, you will lose LR points as your vocabulary usage will be incorrect in succeeding essays.
You are lacking another paragraph presentation in this essay. The best scoring is achieved by 4 paragraph presentations composed of 3-5 sentences each. Your paragraphs should have been divided into sentences. What you presented are more of run-on and long sentence presentations, which will have an adverse effect on your GRA score. Take note of these mistakes. Even if you write more than the required 150 words, if you do not follow the correct format, then point deductions can occur based on scoring considerations and rules.

# 3. INTERNET USERS AS PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION

3. ![img](https://essayforum.com/shared_files/uploaded/85840/331944_1_o.jpg)

## TRAIN

The line graph illustrates the information about the amount of Internet Users in three countries as the propotion of population between 1999 to 2009.

Overall, It is obviously to see that the similar upward trend in three countries over a period of 10 years. The rate in Mexico was always lowest, while the number of American and Canadian in this two countries is quite comparison. 

The percentage of people who using Internet was highest in three countries in the year 1999 and continuously take this place for 2 years to 2001. Howerver, 



## SAMPLE

The line graph gives comparisons of the proportion of Internet usage in three nations between 1999 and 2009.
Overall, ~~the percentage of three countries' population using Internet~~ **witnessed** an upward trend over the period of 10 years. However, there ~~is~~ a more significant rise in the proportion of American and Canadian users compared to Mexicans ones. **(the year/country witnessed not the % witness)**

In 1999, the amount of USA's citizens using Internet stood at the first position at about 20%, while the figures for Canadians and Mexicans were lower, at 5% and 10% respectively. The year 2005 remarked the similarity in the percentage of Internet users at approximately 70% in two countries the USA and Canada. More Mexicans, at the same year 2005, used Internet than last 5 years, accounting for 25% of population. By 2009, almost 100% of Canadians using Internet, positing the highest. The number of users in USA was about 80%, which is 40% higher than that of Mexico.

## FEEDBACK

You should have 4 paragraph.
The first one you can describe and compare USA and Canada
The second one you analyse Mexico because it has separate data compared to other countries.

I think your writing has some mistakes in terms of grammar and the word choice. For instance, the first sentence of the overview paragraph, **it would be better to write the period witnessed changes rather that to write the percentage witnessed changes**. And I saw also the verb tense problem, like ' there is a more significant rise", which is actually should be in simple past tense.

Try to write at least 175 words for the Task 1 essay. That is the word count that will ensure the possibility of a high ending score for your data analysis. You have to make sure that you write 3 paragraphs as well since this is a task 1 essay. Your format is a bit off. It is feels mechanical. There is no real analysis of the data. You are just taking the information straight out of the page and writing about it in the test booklet.

You are not trying to figure out the deeper meaning of the data nor offer an analysis of the data in comparison to the year on year results. There are certain points in the line graph where the data touches one another in the presentation. Those are comparison points that were not represented in your essay. The instruction for this type of image is always inclusive of "make comparisons where relevant". You did everything except that in your presentation.

You show a potential to do a proper analytical essay. The problem is that you did not really apply an analysis to the data. That is also why your presentation is so short. Try to lengthen it up to 190 words so that you can get the full scoring potential of your work. By scoring potential, I mean:

\- You have the ability to analyze the information
\- You understand how the data relates to one another
\- You can represent the importance of the information via the trending statement

Your presentation is creative, with room for more creativity in the presentation. Remember though, do not be over creative in the presentation. Keep the analytical academic tone intact at all times.

Brush up on your subject verb rules (**the line graph give = the line graph gives**). Good job on using estimation words in the essay. Since no actual percentage measurements were given, you were right to connote the information with a sense of uncertainty. This represents an approximation in this instance.

Good attempt at task 1 writing. I look forward to seeing your upcoming improvements.
