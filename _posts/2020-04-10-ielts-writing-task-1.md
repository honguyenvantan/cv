# 1. THE RATIO OF BIRTH AND DEATH IN NEW ZEALAND

![img](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4mHVTiQsxQBMWVGaPC0NXu9npvrtKuhamhnwVJYvNPDz9__47MM4fweXLeUa7UJTIIr6MycvJa-Cy804w36nml_FUjn2g4CJWhnUJD7uD9c2UgX9WTPLFr3Fm6Rqzofr28_dVcoB)

## TRAIN

The line graph illustrates the information about the number of birth and death cases in New Zealand in a course of 200 years from 1901 to 2101.

Overall, It can be seen that although there was some fluatuated changes, over the timeframe, the fertility and deaths rate were expected will increase. Before the year 2041, the number of new baby were born always higher than the death cases, however, this situation was changed from 2041.

In more details, the birth rates fluatuated slightly between 20000 and 30000 during the first 40 years. Following that, there was a dramatically rised in birth rates and reach a high of 65000 in 1961. This rates were 

## SAMPLE 1

The graph shows changes in the birth and death rates in New Zealand since 1901, and forecasts trends tip until 2101.

Between 1901 and the present day, the birth rate has been consistently higher than the death rate. It stood at 20,000 at the start of this period and increased to a peak of 66,000 in 1961. Since then the rate has fluctuated between 65 and 50 thousand and it is expected to decline slowly to around 45,000 births by the end of the century.

In contrast, the death rate started below 10,000 and has increased steadily until the present time. This increase is expected to be more rapid between 2021 and 2051 when the rate will probably level off at around 60,000, before dropping slightly in 2101.

Overall, these opposing trends mean that the death rate will probably overtake the birth rate in around 2041 and the large gap between the two levels will be reversed in the later part of this century.

## SAMPLE

The line graph gives information **concerning (= about)** the changes in New Zealand's **fertility** and **death** rate over the period from 1901 to 2101. Over the 60-year period, from 1901 to 1961, there was **a considerable change** in the birth rates of New Zealand. 

**In more details**, the birth rates fluctuated slightly between 20000 and 30000 during the first 40 years from 1901 to 1941, then growing **exponentially** to 65000 in 1961. Afterwards, **the rate varied** considerably from 50000 to 65000 until the present day and it is **anticipated (= expect, to imagine or expect that something will happen)** to fall slowly to 40000 ~~in~~ the end of the century. (→ at/by the end of something). The death rates, meanwhile, rose gradually from 9000 to nearly 30000 in the twentieth century and maintained at over a half of the birth rates. This was followed by a period of rapid acceleration, with death in the country reaching the peak of 60000 in 2061. However, the following 4 decades is expected to have no more significant changes.
Overall, the huge gap between New Zealand's birth and death rates is probably being reversed at around 2041 ever since.

**"then growing exponentially". You need a comma at this point to break the sentence. It should have been "from 1901 to 1941, and then it grew..."****Or you can use "before" instead.**"in the end of". There is only "at the end of sth"" ever since". I think it is a little bit risky because you are only discussing about the given period from 1901 to 2101.

## FEEDBACK

Clarify your format. The first paragraph should have only the following summary:

- Type of graph

- Measurement indicator

- Years covered

- Sources of measurement- Trending statement

  You must start a new paragraph for every data comparison that you provide. It should not be made as a part of the trending statement as the aforementioned statement is one that creates the direction for the information reporting in the essay. The information presentation should have had its own paragraph starting with; "In more details..."You covered everything in the essay except the **comparison where relevant**. Which means, you did not notice the overlapping information that would have responded to that task requirement. You missed indicating that:
  The data for birth and death has been projected to overlap at about 45 % between the years 2021 and 2041.
  Such a comparison point is important in the analysis of the line graph because it shows the assumed / expected population of the people from New Zealand during that projected time period.

# 2. FORESTED LAND

The table shows forested land in millions of hectares in different parts of the world. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant. You should spend about 20 minutes on this task.![img](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LtUi5JfwokVhxDd2x9303YrVQVnMSEUDkmsBL-Cn2U_5CMjozqp5h8BHwgxckE5csKWPRvjybz5jmjj2xox_0QqpPPeexqARDfUAVMIPDZFc_MfLTv7k1zoY_fhUn0cU3GckwSqw)

## TRAIN





## SAMPLE 1

The chart illustrates data **regarding** forested land **measured by** millions of hectares in multiple regions of the globe. Overall, after the course of 15 years, there was a slight expansion in the forest area in Asia and Europe, **whilst (= while, UK)** the opposite trend was observed in the remained regions. Moreover, European countries always had the largest forest area when compared to the rest.
In 1990, Asian countries had 576 millions of hectares of forest area. This figure slightly dropped to 570 million in 2000 and significantly rose to 584 million after 5 years. Meanwhile, **there was an observable surge** over the period of 15 years in Europe, starting at 989 millions of hectares in 1990 and reaching 1001 million in 2005.
On the other hand, African region lost their forest area dramatically. They used to have 749 millions of hectares in 1990 but this number declined steeply to 691 million in 2005. There was a slight decrease in forested land in North America from 708 millions of hectares to 705 million and this statistic remained unchanged for the next 5 years. **The same trend applied to** Oceania. South America suffered the greatest loss of forest area. After 15 years from 1990, the forest area in this region was measured at 882 millions of hectares, significantly smaller than its figure in 1990 (946 millions of hectares).

## FEEDBACK 1

The task 1 essay should not exceed 190 words because you only have 20 minutes to complete this task. You should not be focused on the number of words as that will never ensure a high score. Your ability to properly explain the image, note important data in your report, along with how you present the information in a grammatically correct manner are what will dictate your passing or failing score. Focus on the content, not the word count. The word count won't get you anywhere if your content is faulty.
Overview information should include a listing of the included global regions in the chart. You can either outline that information or, use the countries as indicative of your trending sentence. Whatever the method you choose, just make sure that all the countries are represented / outlined / listed in the summary overview. That is part of the data presentation outline and adds to the accuracy of your task.
Be consistent in your paragraph starter phrases. **If you use "on the other hand" in the second paragraph, make sure that you used "On the one hand" in the previous paragraph.** The uniformity of presentation is important in each paragraph that you discuss. Be careful with your spelling. Watch out for the red lines that appear under words as you type your text. That represents a misspelled word. You must correct it. Note that the red lines will not appear on the testing center computer, so you have to make sure that you avoid the forced spelling errors by looking for it as you do the practice test. Remember, the LR score will also look at your spelling accuracy and deduct for misspelled and misused words / vocabulary.
Grammar errors:Noun phrase disagreement - 749 millions = million*709 millions of hectares = million*(You consistently make this error in the essay. It could have been corrected if you did some editing work in the paper before you close the essay)
Do not fall prey to forced errors in the essay that could cause you to fail the test. If you apply your editing skills to the copy before you submit the essay, if you focus on content instead of word count, you can avoid those forced errors and perhaps, pass the test.

## SAMPLE 2

The diagram indicates forest area of different districts around the world in 1990, 2000 and 2005.Apparently, forest area of Oceania is the least and Europe has the largest forest land. We can also find that the area of forest land in South America and Africa decreased a lot from 1990 to 2005.
It is clear that the total area of woods in Oceania in 1990, 2000 and 2005 has never been over 200 millions of hectares which is far less than woods areas of other districts. The area of European forest in 1990, 2000 and 2005 is around 1000 millions of hectares which is the most among all districts.
We can see that in 1990 the forest land area of South America is 946 millions of hectares. However, in 2005 it drops to 882 millions of hectares. African forests were faced with the same issue: from 1990 to 2005, its area went down from 749 to 691 millions of hectares.

## FEEDBACK 2

You can use some words that are more formal. For example, significantly instead of a lot.For your last paragragh, I think you can add some more adjectives to enforce that it is dropping immensely.
You need to be precise when it comes to describing the image that is presented to you for analysis. That means, you need to know the difference between a diagram, a chart, a table, and a graph. The graphs come in various forms as well. You need to make sure to use the right descriptive term for the image otherwise you relay wrong information to the reader. What you have here is a table, not a diagram. A diagram is a drawing of a series of instructions for the development of a product or place. You must familiarize yourself with these terms otherwise, you will lose LR points as your vocabulary usage will be incorrect in succeeding essays.
You are lacking another paragraph presentation in this essay. The best scoring is achieved by 4 paragraph presentations composed of 3-5 sentences each. Your paragraphs should have been divided into sentences. What you presented are more of run-on and long sentence presentations, which will have an adverse effect on your GRA score. Take note of these mistakes. Even if you write more than the required 150 words, if you do not follow the correct format, then point deductions can occur based on scoring considerations and rules.

# 3. INTERNET USERS AS PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION

The line graph illustrates the information about the amount of Internet Users in three countries as the propotion of population between 1999 to 2009.

Overall, It is obviously to see that the similar upward trend in three countries over a period of 10 years. The rate in Mexico was always lowest, while the number of American and Canadian in this two countries is quite comparison. 

The percentage of people who using Internet was highest in three countries in the year 1999 and continuously take this place for 2 years to 2001. Howerver, 



## SAMPLE

The line graph gives comparisons of the proportion of Internet usage in three nations between 1999 and 2009.
Overall, ~~the percentage of three countries' population using Internet~~ **witnessed** an upward trend over the period of 10 years. However, there ~~is~~ a more significant rise in the proportion of American and Canadian users compared to Mexicans ones. **(the year/country witnessed not the % witness)**

In 1999, the amount of USA's citizens using Internet stood at the first position at about 20%, while the figures for Canadians and Mexicans were lower, at 5% and 10% respectively. The year 2005 remarked the similarity in the percentage of Internet users at approximately 70% in two countries the USA and Canada. More Mexicans, at the same year 2005, used Internet than last 5 years, accounting for 25% of population. By 2009, almost 100% of Canadians using Internet, positing the highest. The number of users in USA was about 80%, which is 40% higher than that of Mexico.

## FEEDBACK

You should have 4 paragraph.
The first one you can describe and compare USA and Canada
The second one you analyse Mexico because it has separate data compared to other countries.

I think your writing has some mistakes in terms of grammar and the word choice. For instance, the first sentence of the overview paragraph, **it would be better to write the period witnessed changes rather that to write the percentage witnessed changes**. And I saw also the verb tense problem, like ' there is a more significant rise", which is actually should be in simple past tense.

Try to write at least 175 words for the Task 1 essay. That is the word count that will ensure the possibility of a high ending score for your data analysis. You have to make sure that you write 3 paragraphs as well since this is a task 1 essay. Your format is a bit off. It is feels mechanical. There is no real analysis of the data. You are just taking the information straight out of the page and writing about it in the test booklet.

You are not trying to figure out the deeper meaning of the data nor offer an analysis of the data in comparison to the year on year results. There are certain points in the line graph where the data touches one another in the presentation. Those are comparison points that were not represented in your essay. The instruction for this type of image is always inclusive of "make comparisons where relevant". You did everything except that in your presentation.

You show a potential to do a proper analytical essay. The problem is that you did not really apply an analysis to the data. That is also why your presentation is so short. Try to lengthen it up to 190 words so that you can get the full scoring potential of your work. By scoring potential, I mean:

\- You have the ability to analyze the information
\- You understand how the data relates to one another
\- You can represent the importance of the information via the trending statement

Your presentation is creative, with room for more creativity in the presentation. Remember though, do not be over creative in the presentation. Keep the analytical academic tone intact at all times.

Brush up on your subject verb rules (**the line graph give = the line graph gives**). Good job on using estimation words in the essay. Since no actual percentage measurements were given, you were right to connote the information with a sense of uncertainty. This represents an approximation in this instance.

Good attempt at task 1 writing. I look forward to seeing your upcoming improvements.



# 4. THE ART GALLERY IN 2015 AND NOW

The maps below show the changes in the art gallery ground floor in 2015 and present day

![img](https://essayforum.com/shared_files/uploaded/85969/332289_1_o.jpg)

## SAMPLE

The maps illustrate numerous variations taking place in the art gallery ground floor from 2015 to present day.
It is noticeable from the picture that art gallery has changed considerably and a number of new features can be seen in the second diagram. Significantly, there was a drastic change of the western half of the floor.

Looking at the illustrations in more details, we can see that situated to the southwest and next to entrance, ramp for wheel chair was constructed in order to enable every person to contemplate galleries. Get through the door, in the middle of Enter Hall, there was receptionist which was relocated from top - left corner. In the East, three exhibition room 1, 2, 3 witness no change.

On the contrary, lying in the west, exhibition room 4 was divided into two part: temporary exhibition and children's area. Gallery office which was to the north of the exhibition room 4 was demolished and replaced by vending machine. Similarly, gallery shop which in the north-western area was erected at the position where the café used to be. However shop is smaller than the café with the purpose of making way for stairs. There was the emergence of lift which was on the right-hand side of the stairs, which gave people easy and convenient access to the floor.

## FEEDBACK

When you write the Task 1 essay, always consider the audience that you are writing for. Since you are writing this report for a professional, you have to avoid using inflammatory and misleading words in your essay. Using the words like demolished and drastic, when the more appropriate words to use are replaced and significant, respectively, means that you are not familiar with academic writing and logical information presentation. This will affect your LR and GRA score as you are expected to use academic and professionally descriptive tones at all times.

You should not be making assumptions in the essay. Providing reasons for the wheelchair ramp and the lift show that you are making personal observations in the report. These personal observations have no place in the formal data presentation because you are not being asked to offer an opinion or explanation for the images. You are to only report on it. Sure you can be creative, just avoid delivering an opinion while you are at it.

Don't forget to use a comma after an introductory element like "however", which you used as the starting word of a sentence.

Save for the misuse of vocabulary, your essay is pretty much on point. You deliver the required information and compare sections when possible. That shows that you took time to analyze the images presented. However, the errors you made in terms of the final copy of your essay tells me that you did not utilize any left over time you had to perfect the presentation. Always double check the scoring requirements. Make sure you have done your best to score as well as you in every section.

Overall, It's obviouly to see that all of four countries have a upward trend in timeframe. It also can be seen that German spend the most money on book

## SAMPLE

The amount of annual expenditure on books in Germany, France, Italy and Australia is illustrated in the line chart. It is measured in a million US Dollars over a ~~10-years~~ period from 1995 to 2015. It is noticeable that the rate of money spent on books increased in those countries. It also can be seen that Germany had more books over all frame times.

Germany and France spent the most money on books. They began at a large different amount of between 80 and around 55 in 1995. While the France expenditures increased steady over the following ten years, there was a slight decline in Germany during 1999 and 2003. However, the amount then rose to peak at roughly 96 in 2005.

The fluctuated trend also shown in Italy which start at similar level with France, It finished as the lowest in 2015. Compared with Italy, Austria had an increased figures. Began with lowest amount at 30, it saw a dramatic growth in 2001, then overtook Italy in 2003. Australia and Italy reached their peak at 61 and 52 Million US Dollars respectively.

Pey, in my opinion, it would be better if you put conjunction between two sentences in the overview.

It is noticeable that the rate of money spent on books increased in those countries. On the other hand, It also can be seen that Germany ...

I thought overview is one of important thing in writing essay. So, you need conjunction to make your overview better.

## TRAIN

The line graph illustates the information about the rate of birth in 2 countries (China and USA) in a course of 80 years from 1920 to 2000.

Overall, It is obvious to see that both of countries have a same downward trend over the timeframe. Although the two trends were similar in terms of general decline, the birth rates in USA were almost higher than that of China.

To begin, the birth rates of 2 countries started at about 10% in the year 1920. The next 10-year witnessed some slight fluatuated in range of 10 and 15%, before it was seen a drammatically decreased in both of countries to about 5% in years 1940 -1945.



## SAMPLE 1

The line graph compares birth rates in China and the US and how these rates changed from 1920 to 2000.

Overall, the birth rates of both nations decreased over the period of 80 years. Although the two trends were similar **in terms of** a general decline, the birth rate of the USA **in most years was higher than** that of China.
**In the 1920-1935 period**, the birth rate in America fluctuated, although it always remained above 10%. However, in the following decade, the American birth rate fell sharply to below 5%. In the 1950s, the figure for the USA increased significantly to exactly 15%, **which was its highest point during the 80-year**
**period**. Throughout the remainder of the period, there was a gradual decline in the US birth rate, which fell to 7% by the year 2000.

Over the same period, the birth rate in China **varied more significantly than** in the US. It dropped to 5% from 1940 to 1945 before reaching the highest point of the whole line graph, 20%, in 1950. By contrast, 5 years later, the birth rate in China decreased rapidly by over 10%, falling to approximately 2% in 2000.



## SAMPLE 2

The chart illustrates the birth rates shifts between 2 developed countries namely China and the USA from 1920 to 2000.
The overarching trend is that both nations experienced a gradual decrease over the course of 20 years, in which there was a less substantial change in weight occur in the USA.

Taking a closer look at the graph, one can see that **American birth percentage** fluctuated around 12% in the first 20 years before hitting the low at less than 5% in 1945. Then there was a significant ~~recovery~~, reaching to 15% in 1945, followed by a consistent decline to over 5% in 2000. In the case of China, its birth rate varied more dramatically than that of the USA over the same period. After dropping to 5% and remained stable from 1940 to 1945, it recovered and reached the highest points of 20% in 1950. Following that, the China's birth rate halved in 1955 and the downward pattern carried on to roughly 2% in the next 45 years.

## FEEDBACK 2

I think it's better for you to breakdown each year from 1920 to 1950 since the chart is shows significant difference that you can explore more. You can generalize the period of time e.g the last 20 years, when the chart starts to seem stable. I suggest you to take out the opinion words such as "recovery". That's all from me, let's see what the contributor has to say. Good luck!

## SAMPLE 3

The figure given illustrates the fluctuation in Chinese and American birth rates during the period of 80 years.

Overall, both countries **saw a similar trend of reduction** in **their fertility** from 1920 to 2000. Nevertheless, the birth rate of China was lower than **that of the USA for most of the time**.

In the 1920 to 1935 period, the birth rate of America varied constantly at around 12 percent before dropping sharply to just under 5 percent in 1945. However, this low rate did not remain for long, as the USA saw a considerable rise in their birth rate to a peak of 15 percent in 1950. Throughout the remaining period, this rate fell steadily to about 7 percent in 2000.

Over the first 10 years, Chinese birth rate fluctuated but was slightly lower than the American rate before overtaking the latter in 1935, after which there was a slump by 10 percent in 1940. The next 5 years saw no changes in Chinese birth rate; nevertheless, from 1945 to 1950, the rate climbed to its highest point of the 80-year period to exactly 20 percent. By contrast, 50 years later, the birth rate of China went down rapidly to only 2 percent by 2000.

## FEEDBACK 3

According to the requirement, I think it is better to make some comparison between China and Us in a specific period so that you can indicate clearly the change among these two countries. Here are some opinions:

\+ From 1920 - 1930: the rates is almost the same between two countries.
\+ From 1930 - 1955: How is the fluctuation of the rates and compares the highest, the lowest, what is the biggest change
\+ From 1955 - 2000: the deduction is almost the same.
I think when writing a comparison between two or more objects, we should use the time points and period instead of analyzing each country itself.

Your summary overview is not complete as it does not indicate the following information:

- Discussion topic
- Measurement indicator
- Discussion instructions

I know that most tutors ask you to separate all of these information into stand alone sentences. That is not the correct approach as the C&C considerations require every paragraph to be 3-5 sentences long and fully developed in its presentation. That is why the summary overview is very important. You have to remember that the assumption of the Task 1 essay is that you will be able to accurately report on a research paper that has been presented to you for analysis. Assume that the reader will not have access to the illustration you were provided. Therefore, your explanation must be accurate, to the letter, and highly informative.

While there is no right or wrong method of presenting the information, you do need to make sure that you consider the finer details of the presentation that may impress the examiner. For example, in the graph, China had a flat growth rate from 1940 - 1945. That is information that should have been presented in the report but you overlooked in your presentation. Neither did you consider the growth points that overlapped for the two countries in your presentation.

When the instruction asks you to report on main features and make comparisons where relevant, you have to make sure that you do not just look at the obvious information. Look for the uncommon comparison points as well. These are normally the overlapping points, flat indicators, and other smaller details that will not be seen unless an analysis of the graph is actually done. Try to leave yourself with at least 5 minutes to review the elements you are presenting. That way you can include more information in your presentation. After all, you can present up to 5 sentences per paragraph and you are only presenting 3 sentences per paragraph at the moment. There is room for a more accurate representation of the analytical information.
