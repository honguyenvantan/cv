**Topic for 6/3/2021: If you could pass a law right now, what would it be, and why?**

*******************************

Well, become to the president of the USA is not bad. I have so many permissions to make America great again (Like what I said when I was elected). With that promise, I wonder whether I could success with current situation, but I must do somethings. Firstly, I think about the Covid-19 pandemic and want to do something to prevent that, but after all, I remembered they have already produced the Vaccine. No, I want to do something more special. Oh, I knew it. A minority of young people nowadays have the wrong mind about their sex, try to build a society with many people called LGBT. That should be removed immediately for the survival of human civilization, because of its harmful for our new generations. People have that mind cannot give birth, transmit their genetic information for descendants. So, by the time, all these people will remove out of this world by evolutionary theory. 

So, suppose a new law to prevent this situation: capital punishment for the people has behavior and mind to be LGBT, or encourage other people get into that trash. That law will make senses, but law is law. I am the 54th president of the USA, and I announce to pass the law immediately on the time I have the permission.



**Topic for 7/3/2021: What does getting old mean to you?**

*******************************

Everyone almost know that if they getting old, its mean they are more mature and get better. But this point does not right in all situations. With children, getting old means it is a celebration for them, new year holiday or birthday. And they are always waiting for that with much enthusiasm. It has another mean with the one is the juvenile. Getting old means they have more responsible, more   in their decisions to deal in their life.

With me, getting old means I have less time to be together with my family, my life. So I always respect any relationship which is really means to me. 



**Topic for 9/3/2021: Write about someone you used to love.**

*******************************

For a long time since when we were a couple, about two years ago. But I still take all that moments into my heart. She is a girl who was followed by many other boys. Cute, smart, and a good talker, she attracts any other one; and I am not an exception. At that time, I were a worm book, just try too much to study for my future, and maybe because of that, I almost have no skill to make a new relationship with a girl. 

But when I once again got into the national team for biology contest, I had more chances to talk, message with her. Small rain lays great dust, through the daytime, she got fall in love with me. No words or sentences could describe my emotion at that time. And I used to think that would be my first and the last one I loved. But I took a mistake. 

Whatever, she brought the best things ever for me at that time and I appreciate with that. Now, she is studying abroad, hope one day, I will have opportunity to meet her. 

“Sorry, love you and thank you so much.”
