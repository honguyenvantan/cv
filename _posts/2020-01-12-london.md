Recently, I'm learning some stuffs like machine learning by game, or learn some online courses, but I don't think that is good. Because the rising of the internet, everything in this modern life is more complicate than ever. On Facebook, people sharing a lot of informations about free courses which you can easily apply  without thinking. And thats lead to a consequence, you maybe do nothing with these courses. Everyday, you learn just 1 course a little bit and trans. Nothing is get into your mind...

Yes, that is the truth. **Less is more, just enough, not overwhelmed**. You know,
