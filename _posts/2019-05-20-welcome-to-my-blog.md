Nice to comeback to write some interesting things about my life. Not only for saving my memories, but I also used this one for training my writing ability. I quite noob in writing in both English and Vietnamse :), but I will try my best to keep going to writing at least 3 times a week.

Because it haves errors in font type when I write Vietnamse word, so I will try to restrist to write in Vietnamse.

This below content will show me how to use this theme from Pubhina in an effective way:

- Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. 
- To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
- Syntax highlighting: in  https://highlightjs.org/
