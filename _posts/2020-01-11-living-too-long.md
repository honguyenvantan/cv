Today, I'm studying on ielts writing task 2, with a quite interesting topic: Even average life expectancy is increasing nowadays, what problems and solutions should be supposed? So, I read this paper on NCBI to get more knowledges and vocabulary also.

*******************************

Should medical research be focused on increasing the quantity or quality of life? For a variety of reasons, past research has focused more on quantity of life, but the **resultant life extension**, without reducing ageing, has increased the extent of ageing and age-related disease, plus pension, and social and medical costs, **in an unsustainable way**. I argue here that medical research **urgently** (*in a way that needs attention very soon, especially before anything else, because of being very important*) needs to be refocused away from cancer and cardiovascular research, and onto reducing ageing and age-related morbidity, thereby increasing both our health and our wealth.

Human life expectancy has been increasing at a rapid rate [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4328740/#b1). Better health care and hygiene, healthier life styles, sufficient food and improved medical care and reduced child mortality mean that we can now expect to live much longer than our ancestors just a few generations ago. Life expectancy at birth in the EU was about 69 years in 1960 and about 80 years in 2010, which corresponds to a rate of increase in life expectancy of 2.2 years per decade [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4328740/#b1), [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4328740/#b2). If this rate of increase remains unchanged, as it has for the last century, then someone born in the EU today would be expected to live about 100 years.

However, this dramatic increase in life expectancy did not come with a proportionate increase in quality of life for the elderly. Generally, increased life expectancy has increased the risk of disease, disability, dementia and advanced ageing prior to death [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4328740/#b3), [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4328740/#b4). For example, 30% of the population over 60 in the UK become demented before they die, and this proportion is likely to grow as a result of the ageing population and the exponential dependence on age of the prevalence of dementia [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4328740/#b4). In the past, people died young and relatively quickly, but increasingly people die old and slowly from degenerative diseases preceded by years of multiple morbidity and advanced ageing [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4328740/#b5). This puts increasing pressure on the economy and social systems in most countries. Current public expenditure on the retired population—mainly pensions, health and social care—is about 25% of GDP in the EU, but it is expected to rise substantially in the future, challenging economic sustainability [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4328740/#b2).

Medical progress, and the underlying biomedical research that has enabled this progress, is not just a major cause of increased life expectancy, but could also contribute to reducing the morbidity of our ageing populations that threatens our social and economic systems. This raises the important question of what type of medical research we should invest in the coming years and decades, either to further reduce mortality and thereby increasing life expectancy or to reduce ageing and morbidity in order to address the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, disability, detrimental ageing and economic dependency among the elderly.

Public and private investment in medical research is primarily focused on reducing death rates, rather than reducing ageing and age-related disease (Table[(Table1).1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4328740/table/tbl1/)). However, as I argue here, there are medical, economic, ethical and political reasons for favouring medical research that aims to increase quality of life rather than quantity of life.
