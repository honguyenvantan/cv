This guide, styled in the same way as the [Guide to Finding Films](https://bit.ly/Film-Guide), is designed to help locate articles and books. Thanks to [Avery Mensch](https://www.facebook.com/amg.mensch) for letting me use their valuable work, including the graphic above.

[TOC]



# 1. Background

●   What is Sci-Hub?

○   ([Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub)) tl;dr — a website that bypasses many (not all!) academic paywalls to access articles (and sometimes books).

●   How does it work?

○   Generous people with institutional access gave credentials to Alexandra Elbakyan (the founder), which are used to access papers. If a paper has been searched for and retrieved before, it is stored in a server so that all future requests for it are fulfilled instantaneously. New requests sometimes take a minute to fulfill (there is a visual progress bar denoting this) as Sci-Hub cycles through its credentials to try to retrieve the paper.

●   Has Sci-Hub obtained credentials through phishing or other nefarious methods?

○   Despite uncorroborated accusations of such, there is [no evidence](https://engineuring.wordpress.com/2017/07/02/some-facts-on-sci-hub-that-wikipedia-gets-wrong/) of this.

●   What is Library Genesis?

○   ([Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis)) tl;dr — a website that hosts user-uploaded (mostly academic) books and monographs (and some articles).

●   Is this illegal?

○   Depends. Some notes [here](https://engineuring.wordpress.com/2018/07/07/why-sci-hub-is-illegal-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/). But for the purposes of The Philosophical Underclass, the question is moot—Sci-Hub is explicitly endorsed in Rule 2.

 

# 2.[Guide to find and article](sci-hub.se)

1. Locate the DOI (Digital Object     Identifier) of the article if possible (not all articles have DOI’s). The     URL of the article on the publisher’s website will suffice if the DOI does     not exist.
2. Plug the DOI/URL into Sci-Hub     or simply append the DOI to the URL (i.e., sci-hub.se/DOI).
3. You may be prompted to enter a [CAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA). Do not be alarmed that the     text is in Cyrillic. It’s not a Russian virus—it’s simply telling you to     type in the characters in the image to prove that you are a human.     Alexandra Elbakyan, the founder of Sci-Hub, is from Kazakhstan, hence the     Cyrillic text.
4. If you get a completely blank     white screen or “article not found,” Sci-Hub doesn’t have access to that     paper or platform (yet).
5. If you get a molecular     structure spinning graphic (sometimes with a progress bar), that means     that Sci-Hub doesn’t have that paper in its **cache** (i.e., it hasn’t been requested before) but is trying     its credentials to see if it can retrieve it. This usually takes a minute     or less and will either result in (1) the paper showing up, or (2) the     graphic stopping its spinning (with the accompanying Russian text “no     suitable proxy”).
6. Download your paper!

 

**NOTES/FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ERRORS**

●   Sometimes you will get a 500 Internal Server Error or 504 Gateway Time-out. In most cases, this means that Sci-Hub has the paper, but the server is temporarily overloaded. Refreshing the page a few times ought to fix this (you may have to re-enter CAPTCHA’s with every refresh). If it doesn’t work immediately, you can try again a bit later too—it has always worked for me.

●   Sometimes papers on Philosophy Documentation Center journals (that are inaccessible by Sci-Hub) are also on JSTOR, Project Muse, etc., which are typically accessible by Sci-Hub. If you suspect that this is the case, check Google Scholar for all the places that your paper is hosted and try the non-PDC links in Sci-Hub.

●   Does Sci-Hub work on mobile?

○   Yes! Plug in the URL or DOI as you would on desktop. There is also a [Telegram bot](http://t.me/scihubot) that conveniently circumvents the CAPTCHA step (though it may not work for papers not already in Sci-Hub’s cache).

●   Can I search by title on Sci-Hub?

○   If you install the browser plugin (instructions will appear if you type any plain text into the Sci-Hub bar and click Open), yes. Though all this does is direct you to the closest title match (or if none is found, a Google Scholar results page), which can be problematic in the case of book reviews (for example), where the titles are all very similar. DOI or URL search is the most reliable way to use Sci-Hub, generally speaking.

●   “search temporarily unavailable, please use DOI or direct links”?

○   You have entered something other than a DOI or URL (or have somehow mistyped your DOI or URL) and it has thus been parsed as a title search, but unless you have the Sci-Hub plugin installed, title search will not work and you will get this error. Check to make sure you haven’t forgotten a period or slash in your URL, haven’t left in a % in your DOI, etc.

●   If I am looking for a book chapter, will Sci-Hub help?

○   Sometimes. With SpringerLink books, Sci-Hub often has the whole book. Other times if you plug in the DOI of a chapter, it will direct you to the Library Genesis listing for the book. But the bulk of the material on Sci-Hub is articles.

●   I can’t read Cyrillic. What do I do?

○   I explained what the most frequently encountered messages are above—you shouldn’t need more than that. Google Chrome has in-built translation if you fancy that.

●   Sci-Hub is blocked by my Internet Service Provider/institution/etc.—what should I do?

○   Use [Tor Browser](http://torproject.com/download) to circumvent this easily—completely free and no set up (other than initial download) required. It’s simply a web browser that anonymizes your identity by routing your internet traffic through a different network. Also, the aforementioned [Telegram bot](http://t.me/scihubot) will likely work notwithstanding ISP blocks.

●   Which platforms does Sci-Hub have access to? Which does it not?

○   I don’t have an official list, but this is what I have noticed from experience: Taylor and Francis Online, SpringerLink, PEP Web, SagePub, Wiley Online, ScienceDirect, Oxford University Press, Cambridge Core (for books, must use individual chapters’ DOIs/URLs), ScienceDirect (most papers), JSTOR (for some papers), De Gruyter (for some papers), Brill (for some papers), Project Muse (for some chapters—must use individual chapter DOI’s), Oxford Scholarship Online (for some chapters—must use individual chapter DOI’s), Philosophy Documentation Center, ProQuest, HeinOnline, MIS Quarterly. NOTE: just because you find an article hosted on one of these red sites, that does not necessarily mean it’s not on Sci-Hub, because often articles are on multiple databases (e.g., both Project Muse and JSTOR). That’s why it can sometimes be useful to try multiple URLs.

●   I am in search of a rather obscure piece. Will Sci-Hub have it?

○   As implied in the above question, Sci-Hub’s access is independent of how mainstream or obscure the piece is. It depends on which database it is in (and, with some databases, whether it is in a part of the database to which Sci-Hub has access). So, the best thing to do is search for it.

●   How can it be that Sci-Hub has *partial* access to some platforms?

○   Because universities subscribe to subsets of platforms too. (That is why, for example, one can access some Philosophy Documentation Center papers with a particular university’s institutional access but not others.) So, Sci-Hub’s particular subset of access is determined by the credentials it has.

●   How come sometimes I get “article not found” and sometimes just a blank white screen?

○   It would be more user-friendly if Sci-Hub reliably said “article not found” every time it tries to access a platform which it cannot access, but for whatever reason, some inaccessible platforms yield a blank white screen instead.

●   I have access to a database that Sci-Hub doesn’t yet have access to. Can I help improve Sci-Hub?

○   Hopefully! Try [emailing](https://sci-hub.tw/alexandra) Alexandra Elbakyan or sending her a [Facebook message](https://www.facebook.com/alexandra.elbakyan).

# 3. Guide to find a book

1. Search by title, ensuring that     LibGen (Sci-Tech) is the selected option.
2. Click the correct result. If     there isn’t one, Library Genesis does not have your book (yet).
3. You will see a list of mirrors:     click the first one (Gen.lib.rus.ec).
4. Click GET.
5. Your PDF/EPUB/DjVu/MOBI is now     downloaded. Enjoy!

 

**NOTES/FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ERRORS**

●   Do I have to click the first mirror?

○   No, I just wrote that since it’s the simplest. A mirror is simply a website or file on a computer server that has been copied to another computer server so that the site or file is available from more than one place. You can click any of them and follow the respective instructions to download the book. Some people prefer direct download, some people prefer torrents, some people prefer eMule, etc.

●   What’s DjVu? Why is my PDF reader not opening it?

○   A file format similar to PDF. Most PDF readers cannot open it. Simply use an online tool like [this one](https://djvu2pdf.com/) to convert it to PDF.

●   What’s EPUB/MOBI?

○   eReader formats which, unlike PDF, are not paginated. Thus, conversion to PDF is possible, but the pagination will be quasi-arbitrary, and the formatting won’t be so nice. Best to read these on an eReader like [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/).

●   Upon searching, I’m getting “User ‘libgen_read’ has exceeded the ‘max_user_connections’ resource”?

○   Like the aforementioned 500 Internal Server error with Sci-Hub, this is a server-side error. Waiting a minute and searching again usually resolves it.

●   Library Genesis is blocked by my Internet Service Provider/institution/etc.—what should I do?

○   Use [Tor Browser](http://torproject.com/download) to circumvent this easily—completely free and no set up (other than initial download) required. It’s simply a web browser that anonymizes your identity by routing your internet traffic through a different network. You can also try using [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) (which has a built-in [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network)) or [Unblockit](https://unblockit.top/).

●   Does Library Genesis also have articles?

○   Yes. Click on “Scientific articles” (or any of the other options below the search bar) on the home page to access these. I haven’t personally needed to use Library Genesis for articles as Sci-Hub is usually sufficient.

●   You said that Library Genesis hosts user-uploaded books. Does that mean I can upload a book?

○   Yes! Just go to [libgen.is/libarian](http://libgen.is/libarian) (username: genesis, password: upload) and you will see the rules and instructions (e.g., no watermarks, only certain formats, etc.) for doing so there. You can remove watermarks with [Adobe Acrobat Pro](https://telegra.ph/Adobe-latest-pre-activated-software-cc-2020-and-2019-Google-Drive-04-18), and you can remove [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) with [this](https://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/) ([VitalSource](http://vitalsource.com/) ePub instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11eatONdJvvf8wm67w_a8HdJ0spG-4OpdcuLcPn8i2LU/edit?usp=sharing)).

●   The website is asking me for a username and password? Why?

○   The username is genesis and the password is upload. Library Genesis recently implemented an upload queue for quality purpose control, so new uploads that have yet to clear the queue can only be accessed through library.bz, which is password-protected. After clearing the queue (which usually doesn’t take longer than a day), they can be accessed at the regular site.

●   I’m getting a 401 error (on the .bz site)?

○   Don’t use Facebook Preview. You must use a real browser.

 

# 4. Other resources

[**WorldCat**](http://worldcat.org): Useful catalog of books and their holdings in libraries around the world. Often very useful in determining whether or not a native (i.e., published by the publisher, not scanned) eBook of a particular title exists. Search the title and then narrow by eBook in the left sidebar, and then click on the result to see which databases have the eBook.

[**Google Scholar**](http://scholar.google.com): Useful for finding all the places a paper may be published. Often a paper behind a paywall is freely available elsewhere, and Google Scholar usually lists the link.

[**Google**](http://google.com): Obvious but nonetheless often overlooked. I recommend using quotation marks (which search for an exact phrase) to narrow down your results. Sometimes a Google search will reveal places a paper is hosted that were not indexed by Google Scholar (perhaps because they are not “scholarly” websites). A common one is [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/), which, contrary to popular belief, is *not* behind a paywall—one simply has to create a free account and upload any document in order to download something.

[**Internet Archive**](https://archive.org/): Has lots of older books, academic and non-academic. Free account required to borrow books, which can be viewed in [Adobe Digital Editions](https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions.html). They are protected by [Digital Rights Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) (DRM) that forces them to be readable only inside Adobe Digital Editions, but the DRM is easily removable. If a book says “Borrow unavailable,” that usually just means that someone else has currently borrowed it. Refresh the page later (e.g., in an hour or so) and it should be available.

●   **Instructions for downloading books for which a 14 day loan is available:**

○   Create a free account on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/).

○   Borrow the book and click Download Encrypted PDF (or EPUB, if you prefer EPUB). An .acsm file will download. Now proceed to the de-DRM’ing instructions below.

●   **Instructions for downloading books for which a one-hour loan is available:**

○   Create a free account on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/).

○   Borrow the book.

○   In a new tab, copy and paste (don’t hit Enter yet): https://archive.org/services/loans/loan/?action=media_url&identifier=**XYZ**&format=pdf&redirect=1

○   Replace **XYZ** with the bookID: the alphanumeric string after **/details/** in the URL of the book’s main page on the Internet Archive. You can also replace **pdf** with **epub** in the URL if you prefer EPUB format.

○   Now hit Enter. An .acsm file (corresponding to the chosen book and format) will be downloaded when you load this URL.

○   Proceed to the de-DRM’ing instructions below.

●   **Instructions for de-DRM’ing downloaded books:**

○   Download and install the latest version of [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/download). Alternatively, you can download and install [Epubor Ultimate for Mac](https://insmac.org/macosx/562-epubor-ultimate.html) or [ePUBee](https://epubee.com/ebook-converter.html) for Windows.

○   If you choose to use calibre, download [Apprentice Alf’s DeDRM tools](https://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/) and install the calibre plugin ([instructions](https://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/calibre-plugins-the-simplest-option-for-removing-most-ebook-drm/)).

○   Download and install [Adobe Digital Editions](https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html).

○   Open the .acsm file you have downloaded from the Internet Archive in Adobe Digital Editions (double-clicking it should suffice). Don’t worry if it doesn’t display properly.

○   Locate the PDF (or EPUB) file that was downloaded by the .acsm file by right-clicking the book in Adobe Digital Editions (you may have to click the back arrow to return to Adobe Digital Editions’ main screen) and selecting Show File in Explorer (Windows) or Show File in Finder (Mac).

○   Drag the PDF (or EPUB) that you found in Finder/Explorer to calibre (or the other software, if you chose one of those).

○   For calibre users: click “Click to open” next to “Path” in the calibre sidebar to locate the imported PDF (or EPUB) file of the book once it has finished importing. For users of the other software: you should get a message saying that the file has been de-DRM’ed, and you can now locate that file in Finder/Explorer.

○   This file should now be DRM-free. If you wish, you can verify this by opening it in any PDF (or EPUB) application. (Attempting to do the same thing with the previously-located PDF (or EPUB) file straight from Adobe Digital Editions ought to yield blank pages or an error.)

○   Return the book on the Internet Archive wepbage (so that others can borrow it).

○   Bonus: upload the de-DRM’ed book to Library Genesis (instructions in the Library Genesis FAQ above) so that others seeking the same book do not have to go through the same rigmarole!

 

**ProQuest Ebook Central** (URL: https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/your-institution’s ProQuest-handle): Extremely useful book database that has a multitude of books. Try to get on your school proxy’s landing page, then create a personal account for yourself (with your personal email address), and then you will be able to access this from anywhere at any time (even after graduating and losing university access). Some institutions have disabled the account creation functionality (effectively ensuring it can only be used when connected to the institutional network), in which case you cannot use this loophole. Books are downloaded as DRM-protected EPUBs or PDFs to be viewed in Adobe Digital Editions for limited periods of time (but, as aforementioned, can be de-DRM’ed easily by tools such as [these](https://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/2011/01/13/ebooks-formats-drm-and-you-—-a-guide-for-the-perplexed/)).

[**Z-Library**](https://b-ok.cc/): An online library similar to Library Genesis. Rarely have I encountered something there that was not on Library Genesis. (New uploads to Library Genesis are typically automatically uploaded to Z-Library, hence why it shows up on the list of mirrors for most books on Library Genesis and hence why it’s often redundant to check Z-Library if you’ve already checked Library Genesis.)

[**Memory of the World**](https://library.memoryoftheworld.org/#/books/): An online library similar to Library Genesis.

[**AAAAARG**](http://aaaaarg.fail) **(Artists, Architects, and Activists Reading Group)**: Invite-only database of books, mostly humanities. Blocked in the United States and Canada but easily circumvented by Tor ([configure the routing file](https://www.wikihow.com/Set-a-Specific-Country-in-a-Tor-Browser) to consistently go through a European country, for example) or a [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network). I can invite anyone interested: just message me your email address.

[**The Eye**](https://the-eye.eu/public/Books/Bibliotik/): Massive database of eBooks from [Bibliotik](https://www.invitehawk.com/topic/119828-bibliotik-bib-e-learning-2020-review/).

[**Perlego**](https://www.perlego.com/): Database of textbooks and other academic works. Download instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17o_Znpss8pORxFN0Z28CM5XSTyHFLWWEabAGyiR5ECE/edit?usp=sharing).

[**Ask for PDFs from People with Institutional Access**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/850609558335839/): A Facebook group with a self-explanatory title. Here’s their [information guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKL99W5gLVGHpwJ8gN4hNNwo42iXtbAlsiOM9aluTEQ/edit?usp=sharing) and [resource list](https://airtable.com/shrjkF2LcTpB2NqCw/tblEvDbsnM5AcOR6O?blocks=hide).

[**The Philosophical Underclass**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/533403256770678/): A Facebook group similar to [Ask for PDFs from People with Institutional Access](https://www.facebook.com/groups/850609558335839/) but restricted to philosophy.

[**reddit r/Scholar**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scholar/): A subreddit similar to [Ask for PDFs from People with Institutional Access](https://www.facebook.com/groups/850609558335839/).
