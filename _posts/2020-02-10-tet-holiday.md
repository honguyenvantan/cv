Tet holiday is coming! Today is 29th of February in Lunar's calander, just two days later, we will soon have a new journey on our life.

*************************************************

This year, a 2nd-year of Tet is broadened by Covid-19 pandemic. Like all others Vietnamese people, we get used to with this situation, life with medical mask, social distance and not many celebrations are kept hold. I left HCM city since 2nd Feb, after the decision of my University for stopping the examination because of pandemic. It took me about 400k VND for the replacing ticket, with the 2m for the original one :(. But whatever, comeback home is the most important thing now.
