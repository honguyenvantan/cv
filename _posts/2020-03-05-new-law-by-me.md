Topic for today: If you could pass a law right now, what would it be, and why?

*******************************

Well, become to the president of the USA is not bad. I have so many permissions to make America great again (Like what I said when I was elected). With that promise, I wonder whether I could success with current situation, but I must do somethings. Firstly, I think about the Covid-19 pandemic and want to do something to prevent that, but after all, I remembered they have already produced the Vaccine. No, I want to do something more special. Oh, I knew it. A minority of young people nowadays have the wrong mind about their sex, try to build a society with many people called LGBT. That should be removed immediately for the survival of human civilization, because of its harmful for our new generations. People have that mind cannot give birth, transmit their genetic information for descendants. So, by the time, all these people will remove out of this world by evolutionary theory. 

So, suppose a new law to prevent this situation: capital punishment for the people has behavior and mind to be LGBT, or encourage other people get into that trash. That law will make senses, but law is law. I am the 54th president of the USA, and I announce to pass the law immediately on the time I have the permission.
